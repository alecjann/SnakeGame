Hey everyone.

This is a readme for my first game: Snake. I had a blast making this project and learning a bunch of new HTML and Javascript. 
The majority of the code is embedded Javascript in the index.html file. It utilized key handlers to listen for arrow key inputs and move the snake accordingly. The hardest part of the project was figuring out how to update the blocks[][] array which held the coordinates of the the snake segments. 

Controls and Rules:
Use the arrow keys to control the snake (the red square) up, down, left or right. 
Collect fruits (pink) to grow the snake and increase your score.
Once the snake is larger than 2 blocks you cannot reverse direction.
Running into the edge of the grid or any segment of the snake results in a Game Over.

Try to get the highest score you can! Mine is 68.
